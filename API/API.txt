The robocode API, working represents functions that are currently
implemented. Draft represents functions that are currently being
implimented but have their interface finalised. Planned represents
functions that have not yet been implimented.

functions beginning with gamefile. are called within the command or
target_spotted functions.

Working:
		startDirection(): OPTIONAL
				function must return the direction that the robot will
		face at initialization (clockwise). from 0 - 360
		colour(): NEEDED
				  function must return a tuple from (0,0,0) to
		(255,255,255)
		commands():
				function to contain the following movement commands:
				(STEPS represents the frames / distance that the
			command will be run for, or until a collision)
			gamefile.move(STEPS) move a set distance
			gamefile.turn_left(degree)
			gamefile.turn_right(degree)
			gamefile.stop(frames) 
			will stop the robot for the number of frames in frames
			gamefile.robotHealth() 
			will return the value of the
			robot's health (between 1 and 82)
			gamefile.fire() will
			attempt to fire the gun
			gamefile.done() this is NECESSARY,
			it must be called at the end of the loop

		target_spotted(direction):
				will be called when a target is spotted by the radar,
				it will return the direction of the target relative to
				the front of the robot (the same notation as used for
				the gamefile.pointgun(direction) function)
				
				gamefile.pointgun(direction)
						will point the gun in the set direction
						relative to the front of the robot


DRAFT:
		gamefile.lockradar(TEXT) 
			TEXT can be "GUN", "BASE" or
			"FREE" to lock the radar to the surface (have them turn at
			the same time)
		gamefile.spinradar(TEXT)
				text can either be "LEFT" or "RIGHT" and if the radar
				is set to FREE it will spin in that direction.
